<!-- Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.

When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element.

For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.

Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
    
The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element. -->
